# o7d

o7d, short for opencloud, aims to be the core needed for 90% of global cloud deployment needs.

## Philosophy

90% of cloud deployments need the same couple of things:

- Container Management & Deployment
- Blob Storage
- Relational DB Storage
- Scaling Capabilities
- Load Balancing & Networking
- Pub/Sub & Queues
- Observability
- Availability
- Durability
- Role/Permission Management

While there are many reasons to complicate this setup (some of them not that good), o7d aims to be an opinionated way to manage these needs.
