# o7d

o7d, short for opencloud, aims to be the core needed for 90% of global cloud deployment needs.

## Philosophy

90% of cloud deployments need the same couple of things:

- Container Management & Deployment
- Blob Storage
- Relational DB Storage
- Scaling Capabilities
- Load Balancing & Networking
- Pub/Sub & Queues
- Observability
- Availability
- Durability
- Role/Permission Management

While there are many reasons to complicate this setup (some of them not that good), o7d aims to be an opinionated way to manage these needs.

## Project Concepts

1. **RFDs** - RFD stands for "Request for Discussion". Pioneered by [Oxide](https://oxide.computer/), I think a RFD decision making structure for this project would be very fitting. For this project, rfds are stored at the in the /rfds folder, numbered by order of RFD + fittingly named. Check out RFD `1-rfds.md` for more detail on what these documents are, when to use them, and how to use them.
